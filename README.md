# Disease-Specialist-Recommendation-System-Using-Fine-Tuned-BioBERT
The goal of this project is to build an intelligent system that accepts a user query containing a disease name or symptom and accurately suggests the most relevant medical specialist (e.g., Cardiologist, Neurologist, Dermatologist).


Use Case
Input: A natural language query from the user mentioning a disease, condition, or symptom.

Output: The medical specialist most suited to address the condition.

**************************************************
Example:

Query: "I have high blood sugar and frequent urination."
Output: Endocrinologist
***************************************************
Model Used
Pretrained Model: BioBERT — A BERT-based model pretrained on large-scale biomedical corpora such as PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles.

Fine-Tuning: BioBERT is fine-tuned on a custom dataset mapping diseases/symptoms to medical specialties.
****************************************************

Dataset
Custom dataset created with:

Text samples: User-like queries, symptom descriptions, disease mentions.

Labels: Corresponding specialist classes (e.g., "Dermatologist", "Cardiologist", etc.)
*****************************************************
Examples:
"itchy skin and rashes" → Dermatologist  
"chest pain and shortness of breath" → Cardiologist  
"memory loss and confusion" → Neurologist  

******************************************************
Pipeline Overview
Data Collection & Annotation

Gathered medical descriptions, symptom phrases, and associated specialties.

Cleaned and labeled data for classification.

Data Preprocessing

Tokenization using BioBERT tokenizer.

Encoding queries for model input.

Model Training (Fine-Tuning)

Fine-tuned BioBERT using a classification head (e.g., BertForSequenceClassification) for multi-class classification of specialties.
**********************************************************
Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall.

Cross-validation to ensure robustness.
*********************************************************
Deployment (Optional)

Model served via a REST API or integrated into a chatbot interface.
******************************************************


Technologies Used
Python

Transformers (HuggingFace)

PyTorch or TensorFlow

BioBERT (via HuggingFace or original repo)

Scikit-learn for evaluation

Flask/FastAPI for deployment (if applicable)

************************************************************

Potential Extensions
Multi-label classification (some conditions may require more than one specialist).

Integration with symptom-checker tools.

Chatbot-based recommendation system.

Visual dashboards for hospitals/clinics.
